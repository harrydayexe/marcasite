# Get the trader leaderboard

> The ranked board of realized PnL, combos included.

`?time_period=` is `day` (default), `week`, `month` or `all`; `?category=`
is `overall` (default) or a market category; `?sort_by=` picks the `PNL`
(default) or `VOLUME` board. Deeper pages come only from `?cursor=`.

A cursor **pins the board it was minted on**; sort, window and category;
so following it needs no params at all, and restating a different one is a
`400` rather than a silent re-point (the builders-board pattern).

`?user=` answers a different question; one wallet's standing, carrying
**both** the PnL and volume ranks in a single object rather than a page. A
rank of `0` there means unranked for that board, not first. `sort_by`,
`limit` and `cursor` do not apply to that arm.

**`rank` ties and skips**: tied users share a rank and the next one jumps,
so a partition's highest rank approaches its row count. Page with the
cursor; never compute a page from a rank.

Finite windows (day/week/month) serve the MARKED equity change net of
flows; they move with unrealized marks; `all` is the realized-only
lifetime ledger. `volume` is in shares, not USDC.

    The Polymarket Data API: wallet portfolios, trade and activity feeds, market
    state and ranked boards.


    ## Conventions every endpoint shares


    - **Envelope**: every response wraps its payload in `data` (paged routes add
    `pagination`). A documented miss is `data: null` or an empty list, never an
    error.

    - **Pagination is cursor-only**: follow `pagination.next_cursor` until
    `null`; `has_more` is exact, and there is no `offset` query parameter
    (sending one is a `400`). Cursors are signed, typed per endpoint, and
    opaque. The feeds (`trades`, `activity`, combo activity) are keyset walks,
    stable across concurrent writes; the boards, `holders` and most
    combo-position sorts are offset walks behind the opaque token, so a page
    taken across a data refresh can skip or repeat rows. Where a cursor binds
    its cohort (the boards, positions, combo positions), resuming bare is fine,
    restating the same values is fine, and contradicting them is a `400`. The
    `trades`/`activity` feed cursors carry only the seek anchor and page size
    (plus the sort direction on activity): re-send identical filters on every
    page, because changing one mid-walk re-anchors silently.

    - **Rate limiting**: `429` with `Retry-After` is the busy signal for heavy
    queries. A heavy query may first be queued briefly for a capacity slot; the
    `429` arrives only if that short wait ends unserved. Each caller also has a
    per-client request allowance, and bursts past it get the same `429` with
    `Retry-After` sized to the remaining wait. Retry after the given delay. A
    request that could not get a database connection within its budget is NOT a
    `429`: it is a `503` `request_timeout` with `Retry-After`, because the
    shortage is on the server side, not in the caller's rate.

    - **Identifiers**: `condition` (aliases `condition_id`, `conditionId`) is
    the unified query key for on-chain 0x condition ids; `market_id` fields
    carry Gamma's own market ids; `event_id` takes Gamma event ids; `token_id`
    is the CLOB asset id (the key on `/v2/prices-history`).

    - **Params** accept both snake_case and camelCase spellings.

    - **Units**: bare `volume`/`size` values are **shares**; `_usdc` suffixed
    fields are USD; `taker_` prefixed volumes are one-side.

    - **Sentinels**: `outcome_index: 999` means the outcome could not be
    labeled; a missing or `null` numeric field means unavailable, never zero.

    - **Windows on `/v2/trades?user=` and `/v2/activity`**: an omitted or `0`
    `start` floors to three years back (`start=1` asks for full history); an
    omitted or `0` `end` is now plus one day. The other `/v2/trades` shapes
    ignore `start`/`end`: `condition`/`event_id` serve a fixed three-year window
    and the bare feed serves the rolling current-plus-previous month. Other
    windowed routes treat omitted/`0` bounds as unbounded; each documents its
    own rule. `/v2/prices-history` is the strict one, where a `0` bound is a
    `400`.

    - **Errors**: every unsuccessful response is JSON with a human-readable
    `error`, stable `code`, `retryable` flag, and opaque `trace_id`; validation
    failures may also name `parameter`. Codes map to statuses as follows:
    `invalid_request` = `400`, `not_found` = `404`, `method_not_allowed` =
    `405`, `rate_limited` = `429`, `internal` = `500`, and both
    `request_timeout` (the request deadline, the datastore's statement timeout,
    or the connection pool's acquire budget) and `dependency_unavailable` =
    `503`. A `429` or `503` that is worth retrying carries `Retry-After` in
    seconds. Every response, successful or not, echoes the same id in the
    `x-trace-id` header; supply it when reporting a failure so operators can
    correlate it with telemetry.

    - **Auth**: none. All data routes are public; no API key or token is
    required.

      description: >-
        The ranked board of realized PnL, combos included.


        `?time_period=` is `day` (default), `week`, `month` or `all`;
        `?category=`

        is `overall` (default) or a market category; `?sort_by=` picks the `PNL`

        (default) or `VOLUME` board. Deeper pages come only from `?cursor=`.


        A cursor **pins the board it was minted on**; sort, window and category;

        so following it needs no params at all, and restating a different one is
        a

        `400` rather than a silent re-point (the builders-board pattern).


        `?user=` answers a different question; one wallet's standing, carrying

        **both** the PnL and volume ranks in a single object rather than a page.
        A

        rank of `0` there means unranked for that board, not first. `sort_by`,

        `limit` and `cursor` do not apply to that arm.


        **`rank` ties and skips**: tied users share a rank and the next one
        jumps,

        so a partition's highest rank approaches its row count. Page with the

        cursor; never compute a page from a rank.


        Finite windows (day/week/month) serve the MARKED equity change net of

        flows; they move with unrealized marks; `all` is the realized-only

        lifetime ledger. `volume` is in shares, not USDC.
