# List a market's top holders

> Top holders of a market, netted per user and grouped by
outcome token.

`?condition=` (CSV of `condition_id`) is required (400 otherwise). `?limit=`
(default 100, max 1000; v2 family-uniform) sizes the page **per outcome
token**; `?min_balance=` filters the served amount.

`?include_pnl=true` opts each holder row into the position economics
(entry price and cost, current price and value, realized, unrealized and
total profit) and switches the amounts to per-side gross balances, so a
wallet holding both outcomes appears under both tokens. The default
response is unchanged. This mode serves one market's table at a time:
exactly one `condition` and `limit` at most 100 (400 otherwise, including
via a cursor that carries a wider window).

A malformed condition id is a `400` naming the value; a well-formed one
that resolves to no holdings serves an empty `data` array, which is the
meaningful zero-state.

Deeper pages come only from `?cursor=` (which carries the page window and
overrides `limit`).

Page walks advance every token group together, so a group leaves `data`
once its token is exhausted while others keep paging; no rows are lost,
but merge pages by `token_id`, not by array position.

    The Polymarket Data API: wallet portfolios, trade and activity feeds, market
    state and ranked boards.


    ## Conventions every endpoint shares


    - **Envelope**: every response wraps its payload in `data` (paged routes add
    `pagination`). A documented miss is `data: null` or an empty list, never an
    error.

    - **Pagination is cursor-only**: follow `pagination.next_cursor` until
    `null`; `has_more` is exact, and there is no `offset` query parameter
    (sending one is a `400`). Cursors are signed, typed per endpoint, and
    opaque. The feeds (`trades`, `activity`, combo activity) are keyset walks,
    stable across concurrent writes; the boards, `holders` and most
    combo-position sorts are offset walks behind the opaque token, so a page
    taken across a data refresh can skip or repeat rows. Where a cursor binds
    its cohort (the boards, positions, combo positions), resuming bare is fine,
    restating the same values is fine, and contradicting them is a `400`. The
    `trades`/`activity` feed cursors carry only the seek anchor and page size
    (plus the sort direction on activity): re-send identical filters on every
    page, because changing one mid-walk re-anchors silently.

    - **Rate limiting**: `429` with `Retry-After` is the busy signal for heavy
    queries. A heavy query may first be queued briefly for a capacity slot; the
    `429` arrives only if that short wait ends unserved. Each caller also has a
    per-client request allowance, and bursts past it get the same `429` with
    `Retry-After` sized to the remaining wait. Retry after the given delay. A
    request that could not get a database connection within its budget is NOT a
    `429`: it is a `503` `request_timeout` with `Retry-After`, because the
    shortage is on the server side, not in the caller's rate.

    - **Identifiers**: `condition` (aliases `condition_id`, `conditionId`) is
    the unified query key for on-chain 0x condition ids; `market_id` fields
    carry Gamma's own market ids; `event_id` takes Gamma event ids; `token_id`
    is the CLOB asset id (the key on `/v2/prices-history`).

    - **Params** accept both snake_case and camelCase spellings.

    - **Units**: bare `volume`/`size` values are **shares**; `_usdc` suffixed
    fields are USD; `taker_` prefixed volumes are one-side.

    - **Sentinels**: `outcome_index: 999` means the outcome could not be
    labeled; a missing or `null` numeric field means unavailable, never zero.

    - **Windows on `/v2/trades?user=` and `/v2/activity`**: an omitted or `0`
    `start` floors to three years back (`start=1` asks for full history); an
    omitted or `0` `end` is now plus one day. The other `/v2/trades` shapes
    ignore `start`/`end`: `condition`/`event_id` serve a fixed three-year window
    and the bare feed serves the rolling current-plus-previous month. Other
    windowed routes treat omitted/`0` bounds as unbounded; each documents its
    own rule. `/v2/prices-history` is the strict one, where a `0` bound is a
    `400`.

    - **Errors**: every unsuccessful response is JSON with a human-readable
    `error`, stable `code`, `retryable` flag, and opaque `trace_id`; validation
    failures may also name `parameter`. Codes map to statuses as follows:
    `invalid_request` = `400`, `not_found` = `404`, `method_not_allowed` =
    `405`, `rate_limited` = `429`, `internal` = `500`, and both
    `request_timeout` (the request deadline, the datastore's statement timeout,
    or the connection pool's acquire budget) and `dependency_unavailable` =
    `503`. A `429` or `503` that is worth retrying carries `Retry-After` in
    seconds. Every response, successful or not, echoes the same id in the
    `x-trace-id` header; supply it when reporting a failure so operators can
    correlate it with telemetry.

    - **Auth**: none. All data routes are public; no API key or token is
    required.

        `?limit=`

        (default 100, max 1000; v2 family-uniform) sizes the page **per outcome

        `?include_pnl=true` opts each holder row into the position economics

        (entry price and cost, current price and value, realized, unrealized and

        A malformed condition id is a `400` naming the value; a well-formed one
