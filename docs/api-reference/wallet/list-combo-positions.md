# List combo positions

> Combo positions for a user, in the standard
`{ data, pagination }` envelope.

Sorts: `FIRST_ENTRY` (default) | `ENTRY_COST` (+ `CURRENT_VALUE` alias) |
`UPDATED`, each with `sort_direction`. `FIRST_ENTRY DESC` pages by the
two-state keyset anchor `(first_entry_at_micros, combo_condition_id,
outcome_index)` (NULL micros = the NULL tail); `UPDATED ASC` by the
single-state `(updated_at_micros, …)` anchor; every other combination by an
offset-shaped token. The cursor binds sort + direction and the resume
ADOPTS them, so a replay cannot flip or re-sort the walk mid-stream.

It binds the cohort; `user`/`status`/`condition`/`updated_after`/
`updated_before`; the same way: following a
page needs nothing but `?user=` (always required here) and `?cursor=`, and
restating a filter is allowed but must agree. Omitting one is not a
contradiction, it is the absence of a choice; **contradicting** one is a
400, because the token's walk state only means anything against the cohort
it was minted on.

Incremental sync: `updated_after`/`updated_before` are an INCLUSIVE
epoch-second window on `updated_at`. Without a `status` filter, either
bound switches the response to the mirror-complete sync view (every live
row, not only held ones); a `status` filter keeps its own visibility. The
upper end is always capped by a short stability ceiling (~90s behind now)
so a mirror never reads rows that may still move. Pair with
`sortBy=UPDATED&sortDirection=ASC` for the stable sync order.

A malformed `condition` combo condition id is a `400` naming the value; a
well-formed one that matches nothing serves an empty `data` array, which
is the meaningful zero-state.

  title: Polymarket Data API v2
  description: >-
    The Polymarket Data API: wallet portfolios, trade and activity feeds, market
    state and ranked boards.


    ## Conventions every endpoint shares


    - **Envelope**: every response wraps its payload in `data` (paged routes add
    `pagination`). A documented miss is `data: null` or an empty list, never an
    error.

    - **Pagination is cursor-only**: follow `pagination.next_cursor` until
    `null`; `has_more` is exact, and there is no `offset` query parameter
    (sending one is a `400`). Cursors are signed, typed per endpoint, and
    opaque. The feeds (`trades`, `activity`, combo activity) are keyset walks,
    stable across concurrent writes; the boards, `holders` and most
    combo-position sorts are offset walks behind the opaque token, so a page
    taken across a data refresh can skip or repeat rows. Where a cursor binds
    its cohort (the boards, positions, combo positions), resuming bare is fine,
    restating the same values is fine, and contradicting them is a `400`. The
    `trades`/`activity` feed cursors carry only the seek anchor and page size
    (plus the sort direction on activity): re-send identical filters on every
    page, because changing one mid-walk re-anchors silently.

    - **Rate limiting**: `429` with `Retry-After` is the busy signal for heavy
    queries. A heavy query may first be queued briefly for a capacity slot; the
    `429` arrives only if that short wait ends unserved. Each caller also has a
    per-client request allowance, and bursts past it get the same `429` with
    `Retry-After` sized to the remaining wait. Retry after the given delay. A
    request that could not get a database connection within its budget is NOT a
    `429`: it is a `503` `request_timeout` with `Retry-After`, because the
    shortage is on the server side, not in the caller's rate.

    - **Identifiers**: `condition` (aliases `condition_id`, `conditionId`) is
    the unified query key for on-chain 0x condition ids; `market_id` fields
    carry Gamma's own market ids; `event_id` takes Gamma event ids; `token_id`
    is the CLOB asset id (the key on `/v2/prices-history`).

    - **Params** accept both snake_case and camelCase spellings.

    - **Units**: bare `volume`/`size` values are **shares**; `_usdc` suffixed
    fields are USD; `taker_` prefixed volumes are one-side.

    - **Sentinels**: `outcome_index: 999` means the outcome could not be
    labeled; a missing or `null` numeric field means unavailable, never zero.

    - **Windows on `/v2/trades?user=` and `/v2/activity`**: an omitted or `0`
    `start` floors to three years back (`start=1` asks for full history); an
    omitted or `0` `end` is now plus one day. The other `/v2/trades` shapes
    ignore `start`/`end`: `condition`/`event_id` serve a fixed three-year window
    and the bare feed serves the rolling current-plus-previous month. Other
    windowed routes treat omitted/`0` bounds as unbounded; each documents its
    own rule. `/v2/prices-history` is the strict one, where a `0` bound is a
    `400`.

    - **Errors**: every unsuccessful response is JSON with a human-readable
    `error`, stable `code`, `retryable` flag, and opaque `trace_id`; validation
    failures may also name `parameter`. Codes map to statuses as follows:
    `invalid_request` = `400`, `not_found` = `404`, `method_not_allowed` =
    `405`, `rate_limited` = `429`, `internal` = `500`, and both
    `request_timeout` (the request deadline, the datastore's statement timeout,
    or the connection pool's acquire budget) and `dependency_unavailable` =
    `503`. A `429` or `503` that is worth retrying carries `Retry-After` in
    seconds. Every response, successful or not, echoes the same id in the
    `x-trace-id` header; supply it when reporting a failure so operators can
    correlate it with telemetry.

    - **Auth**: none. All data routes are public; no API key or token is
    required.
